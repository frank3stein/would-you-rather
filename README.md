# Would you rather game

The app was bootstrapped with create-react-app. Other than that it was build from ground up. I have used this project to learn Redux and have used react-redux library to connect redux to React. Additionally I practised the new Hooks API. 


You can clone the project and start it with the following commands. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/frank3stein/would-you-rather.git
npm install
npm start
```
